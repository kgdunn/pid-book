.. To add

	* see p 295 of Devore here for in-class example
	* Put "paired" tests under the main section of testing for differences	
	* Explain more clearly when a paired test is required vs a test of differences
	* Chi-squared goodness of fit test for normality; also a way to introduce the chi-squared test
	
Univariate data analysis in context
====================================

This section is an introduction to the area of data analysis. We cover concepts from univariate data analysis, specifically the concepts shown in the pictorial outline below. This section is only a *review of these concepts*; for a more comprehensive treatment, please consult an introductory statistics textbook (see the recommended readings further down)

The material in this section is used whenever you want to learn more about a single variable in your data set:

	- *Co-worker*: Here are the yields from a batch system for the last 3 years (1256 data points)
		
		- what sort of distribution do the data have?
		- yesterday our yield was less than 50%, what are the chances of that happening under typical conditions?
		
	- *Yourself*: We have historical failure rate data of the pumps in a section of the process. What is the probability that 3 pumps will fail this month?
	
	- *Manager*: does reactor 1 have better final product purity, on average, than reactor 2?
	
	- *Colleague*: what does the 95% confidence interval for the density of our powder ingredient really mean?

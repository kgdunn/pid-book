Summary
==========

Montgomery and Runger list 5 reasons why monitoring charts are widely used. After this section of the book you should understand the following about the charts and process monitoring:

	#.	These tools are proven to improve productivity (i.e. to reduce scrap and rework, as described above), and to increase process throughput.
	#.	They detect defective production, consistent with the concept of "doing it right the first time", a mantra that you will increasingly hear in the manufacturing workplace.
	#.	A monitoring chart with good limits will prevent over-control of the process. Operators are trained not to make process adjustments unless there is a clear warning or alarm from the chart.
	#.	The patterns generated by the plots often help determine what went wrong, providing some diagnostic value to the operators. We will see a more formal tool for process diagnosis though in the :ref:`latent variable section <SECTION_latent_variable_modelling>`.
	#.	Monitoring charts are required to judge if a process is stable over time. A stable process allows us to calculate our process capability, which is an important metric for your customers.

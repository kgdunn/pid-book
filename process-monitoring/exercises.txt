* Is it fair to say that a control chart is like an on-line version of a confidence interval?  Explain your answer.

* Detection system: show effect of larger sample size; delayed detection

* Data with outliers and missing values (boards data set?)
    - develop limits
    - monitor Shewhart chart (raw and subgrouped)
    - monitor with CUSUM
    - monitor with EWMA (MA vs EWMA)
    
* Relationship between Shewhart and Cpk

* Batch yields (300 values)
    - Shewhart charts for groups of 5 runs
    - How to estimate sigma

* See exercises in your pencil notes

* Reading: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Toyota_Way The Toyota Way

* Monitoring of a different sort: http://singularityhub.com/2009/03/20/body-20-continuous-monitoring-of-the-human-body/

* You will calculate in the assignment that a shift of :math:`1.5\sigma` from process center will introduce only 3.4 defects per million.  This shift would reduce your |Cpk| from 2.0 to 1.5.

* Show how EWMA chart can detect changes in variance also


..	EWMA monitoring 
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	In the class we showed how the EWMA is able to predict one step into the future, which for slow moving processes is a really helpful feature.

	The following measurements of BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) 

	Complete the following table, then show the values from your table on the accompanying plot: use circles to show the actual measurements, and use squares to show the EWMA one-step ahead predictions.

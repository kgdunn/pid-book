% Experiment in book publishing


% This book is an experiment.  And as in all good experiments we are testing the effect of changing more than one variable at a time.

% Firstly, this book is not available from a publisher. Of course a publisher adds value by having the manuscript professionally reviewed, they do a nice layout and printing the material, and marketing and distribution of the final product.  In exchange the publisher takes a cut of the sales and almost always retains the intellectual property rights to the book.  This is a very crude description, but regardless of the publisher's effectiveness, the result is an increased cost to the final user.

This book is a preliminary draft on how to improve processes using the vast quantities of data that are now available. 

A more formal preface will appear here shortly, but please note:
\begin{itemize}

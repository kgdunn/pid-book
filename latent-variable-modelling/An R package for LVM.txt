=======================

Must show the correct result for a matrix of only random numbers
Must show the correct result for a full factorial (orthogonal X), unreplicated
Must match when a PCA and PLS model are constructed with known number of LV's
Must match when in PLS we have an |X| space of given dimension and a |Y| space of given dimension and the link between them is established artificially.  How many components are appropriate?

# Ideally, I would like to use boxplots that show the mean and standard deviation, not the median and interquartile range
 
# library(ggplot2)
# qplot(props,geom="boxplot")
# #a simple qplot with a boxplot geometry - n.b., I like the bw theme
# qplot(class, hwy, fill=factor(year), data=mpg, geom="boxplot", position="dodge")+theme_bw()

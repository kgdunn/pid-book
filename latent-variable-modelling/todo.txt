Teaching PCA in a logical way

* Use the Food Texture case study: what relationships do you see?
 - write them all down by hand: this is correlated with that, etc.
* Interesting to start with the 2D monitoring issue, to justify the use of PCA???

* Start with showing the N x K matrix
* Give different examples
* Explain that PCA has only 1 objective: explain variance
* Use the 4 temperatures examples
 - LV is a linear combination
 - what is a linear combination? In this case it is just the average
 - emphasize that each variable contributes
 - show N*K matrix, with a new T scores matrix (column if A=1) next to it
 - show the 2D plot of 2 temperatures: correlation seen of a 'line'
 - show the 3D plot of 3 of the 4 temperatures: a 'line' still
 - likely in 4D it is also a line
 - show t1 visually for the temperatures: it is just a single number, summarizing the 4 numbers
 - the PCA model is in this case a 1 dimensional line for 4 variables
* Show the YouTube video of temperatures  in the spinning cube
* Show the YouTube video of Abel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pnQd6jnCWk
 - emphasize that the data are prescaled: we will come back to that later
 - the plane is fit so that it minimizes the distance.
 - in this case the PCA model is 2 dimensional plane for 3 variables

* Now use the Food Texture case study
 - calculate 2 components
 - look at PC 1
 - do you see the matching interpretation of the scatterplot matrix with the loadings interpretation?
 - look at bi-plot also
 - which observation is most similar to sample XXX? Verify it in the raw data.
 - which observation is most dissimilar to sample YYY? Verify it in the raw data.

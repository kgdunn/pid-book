""" wingdbstub.py    -- Debug stub for debuggifying Python programs

Copyright (c) 1999-2001, Archaeopteryx Software, Inc.  All rights reserved.

Written by Stephan R.A. Deibel and John P. Ehresman

Usage:
-----

This is the file that Wing DB users copy into their python project 
directory if they want to be able to debug programs that are launched
outside of the IDE (e.g., CGI scripts, in response to a browser page
load).

To use this, edit the configuration values below to match your 
Wing IDE installation and requirements of your project.

Then, add the following line to your code:

  import wingdbstub

Debugging will start immediately after this import statements.

Next make sure that your IDE is running and that it's configured
to do passive listening and accept passive connections from the
host the debug program will be running on.

Now, invoking your python file should run the code within the debugger.
Note, however, that Wing will not stop in the code unless a breakpoint
set set.

If the debug process is started before the IDE, or is not listening
at the time this module is imported then the program will run with
debugging until an attach request is seen.  Attaching only works 
if the .wingdebugpw file is present; see the manual for details.

One win32, you either need to edit WINGHOME in this script or
pass in an environment variable called WINGHOME that points to
the Wing IDE installation directory.

# This is only used when the debug process is not attached to

# internals to a file.  If the file does not exist, it will be created

# It turns off automatic detection of program quit so that the debug session
# can span multiple script invocations.  When this is turned on, you may
# need to call ProgramQuit() on the debugger object to shut down the
# debugger cleanly when your application exits or discards the Python
# instance.  If multiple Python instances are created in the same run,
# only the first one will be able to debug unless it terminates debug
# and the environment variable WINGDB_ACTIVE is unset before importing
# this module in the second or later Python instance.  See the Wing
# IDE manual for details.

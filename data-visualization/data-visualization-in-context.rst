Data visualization in context
=============================

This is the first chapter in the book. Why?  Every engineer has heard the phrase "plot your data," but seldom are we shown what appropriate plots look like.

In this section we consider quantitative plots -- plots that show numbers. We cover various plots that will help you learn more from your data, and we end with a list of tips for effective data visualization.

.. AU: I am taking "section" to mean, e.g., "1.2 Usage examples". In the following sentence and elsewhere, I change it to "chapter" if appropriate.

You can use the material in this chapter when you must learn more about your system from the data. For example, you may get these questions:

	* *Co-worker*: Here are the yields from a batch system for the last 3 years (1256 data points). Can you help me

		* understand more about the time trends in the data?
		* efficiently summarize the batch yields?

	* *Manager*:  How can we effectively summarize the (a) number and (b) types of defects on our 17 aluminium grades for the last 12 months?

	* *Yourself*: We have 24 different measurements against time (5 readings per minute, over an interval of 300 minutes) for each batch we produce. How can we visualize these 36,000 data points?
